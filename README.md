# Owners of a small commuter airline want a website where customers to be able to view flight 
# information and reserve tickets for flights using a Web registration system, they also want it to be with MSSQL DB and using OOP.

After interviewing the business managers and the ticketing agents, the software designers draft an SRS document that lists the system’s functional requirements. 
The following are some of these requirements
1. Nonregistered web users can browse to the web site to view flight information, but they can’t book flights
2. New customers who want to book flights must complete a registration form providing their name, address, company name(optional), phone number, and e-mail address
3. A customer is classified as either a corporate customer or a retail customer
4. Customers can search for flights based on destination and departure times.
5. Customers can book flights indicating the flight number and the number of seats requested
6. The system sends customers a confirmation via e-mail when the flight is booked
7. Ticket reservations may be canceled up to one week in advance for an 80 percent refund
8. Ticketing agents can view and update flight information
9. Payment is done using only BTC
